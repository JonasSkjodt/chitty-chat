## How to use

Open the server from root folder: go run .\server\server.go

The server must be opened before the client can access it.

Open a client from root folder: go run .\client\client.go -name alice
(choose another name in another terminal to open a new client)

Once the client is logged into the server, go ahead and write your message.

Type "exit" in the client terminal once you'd like to disconnect from the server.
